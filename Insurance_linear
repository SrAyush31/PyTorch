#Insurance cost prediction using linear regression.

we're going to use information like a person's age, sex, BMI, no. of children and smoking habit to predict the price of yearly medical bills. This kind of model is useful for insurance companies to determine the yearly insurance premium for a person. The dataset for this problem is taken from Kaggle.

We will create a model with the following steps:

1. Download and explore the dataset
2. Prepare the dataset for training
3. Create a linear regression model
4. Train the model to fit the data
5. Make predictions using the trained model
