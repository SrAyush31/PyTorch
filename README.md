# Deep Learning with PyTorch: Zero to GANs
Topics:
LESSON 1 - PyTorch Basics and Gradient Descent
         - PyTorch basics: tensors, gradients, and autograd
         - Linear regression & gradient descent from scratch
         - Using PyTorch modules: nn.Linear & nn.functional

LESSON 2 - Working with Images and Logistic Regression
         - Training-validation split on the MNIST dataset
         - Logistic regression, softmax & cross-entropy
         - Model training, evaluation & sample predictions

LESSON 3 - Training Deep Neural Networks on a GPU
         - Multilayer neural networks using nn.Module
         - Activation functions, non-linearity & backprop
         - Training models faster using cloud GPUs
